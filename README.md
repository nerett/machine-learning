# machine learning

The code here follows [these](https://github.com/andriygav/MachineLearningSeminars/blob/e8f7724270957099e50da873f65e3bc22d9b57d1/README.rst) seminars for [ML course by K.V. Vorontsov](https://bit.ly/ML-Vorontsov) read for MIPT students. Some tasks may change with time, so keep in mind that the code here is aimed at solving 2024/25 tasks. This repo follows the structure of 2 folders connected to 2 course semesters:

1. **Mathematical basics of machine learning** - this is all things about `scikit-learn` basics like multiclass classifications using linear/logistic regression, Parzen window and SVM
2. **Applied models of machine learning** - more complex and applied tasks (using `pytorch` and GPU acceleration) that include: CNN, LSTM, AE/VAE, image annotations, usage of fasttext, bigARTM in text date prediction

Some of the tasks here were completed collaboratively in groups or taken from other students (btw some of them decided to remain anonimous), see credits in corresponding *README* files.
